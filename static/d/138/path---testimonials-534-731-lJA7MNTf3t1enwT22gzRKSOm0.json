His technical abilities are A+ but that is just the beginning. He is someone that can really do it all, our toughest problems are what he handled for D&H, his communications are excellent, his people and project management skills are dead on. IF you are looking for a manager of people and projects who can roll up his sleeves and make it happen if need be, he would be a great choice for you. We had to part ways because of a downsizing and I would hire him back in a minute.","date":"2010-10-19","image":null}},{"node":{"name":"Glen West","title":"Enterprise Architect","company":"D&H Distributing","phone":"Glen.west@gmail.com","text":"Darrell has a breadth of technical knowledge normally found in Architects and is well versed in all current Progress technologies. He constantly shared his knowledge with others, helping them achieve their goals as well as achieving his own. Darrell has a good business sense as well, and the ability to communicate clearly and easily with both the business user and the developer. His positive demeanor made him a pleasure to work with and be around. I would love to work with him again in any environment.","date":"2009-10-27","image":null}},{"node":{"name":"Mark Karmazin","title":"Equity Support Manager","company":"Credit Suisse","phone":"212-325-4068","text":"Darrell is a very detail oriented, responsible and reliable professional.

He enjoys digging into various technologies, languages and tools, even if he has not been formally trained on them. That alone makes him highly valuable when you team has to be lean and nimble yet effective across many business problems. I highly recommend Darrell where results are important, you need someone who is confident yet capable, and can be relied on to accomplish the task.","date":"2010-05-05","image":null}},{"node":{"name":"Chris Combs","title":"CIO","company":"Pet Partners Inc","phone":"919-859-8240","text":"... our experience in recovery with Darrell Davis was excellent.  Darrell came in (By parachute to use a metaphor) into our disaster zone, and helped us recover from a very difficult situation.  As of Thursday of last week, we were back in business running better with our existing application running on a new server better and faster than we ever had under our old server environment.  What more can I say than that Darrell, as a representative of Allegro, gave us excellent service and support, and got our entire company back up and running in less than one week.","date":"2009-02-07","image":null}},{"node":{"name":"Eileen Torrens","title":"Asst VP DBA","company":"American Home Mortgage","phone":"631-433-9213","text":"Darrell is an extremely intelligent, talented and motivated professional.

He is one of those rare individuals who can tackle any task he is given and come out looking as if he is an old pro, even if it is something new to him. He is also very personable, but also know the technical as well as anyone, another rare, but valuable combination.
